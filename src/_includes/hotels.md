We are not reserving a room block, but we recommend staying in Atlanta’s Midtown neighborhood for the most convenient and enjoyable experience.

Midtown offers easy access to the venue, beautiful green spaces, and great dining.


### Hotels we recommend:
- Within walking distance of The Fox: 
  - The Georgian Terrace
  - Courtyard/Element Midtown
  - Renaissance Midtown
- A bit farther but still a favorite:
  - The Bellyard
  - Loews Atlanta Hotel
  - Moxy Midtown

All wonderful options with easy walking access to great coffee, restaurants, and things to do 

If you’re looking for a more unique, boutique stay close to the beltline, we also recommend Hotel Clermont and The Forth Hotel.
