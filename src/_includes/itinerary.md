The Iberian Pig

**Attire** : Elevated Casual
  - Dressy but relaxed: think cocktails at a great restaurant.
  - More polished than casual, but less formal than cocktail attire. 
  - *For ladies:* a skirt and blouse, or a dress you might wear to work or an early evening event.
  - *For gentlemen:* khakis or dark, well-fitted jeans paired with a collared shirt.
 
**Parking:**
There is ample parking in downtown Decatur.  
We recommend the [parking garage at the Courthouse (125 W Trinity Pl)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nWuZpV7a8Wm2c66b8): $6.00 flat for the entire evening.


## Friday, April 10th: The Main Event
We're getting married! We can't wait to celebrate with you.  

The ceremony will begin **promptly at 5:00 PM**, with the reception immediately to follow. Late comers will be able to join for cocktail hour after the ceremony, so be on time!

Expect excellent food, music to dance to, and just a touch of revelry
